Drupal 8 application made fully by myself with purpose of learning, a recipe website. Logged in user is able to check a recipe he has made and also rate some recipes using forms created with a custom module. Ajax was used for these forms and jQuery was used for node pages. Author is able to create a new recipe. For the purpose of this site, subtheme was used with some custom CSS. Some preprocess methods have been applied as well as methods for improving the functionality of existing elements and modules. A module for meta tags has also been created to place them on pages. They can be manually changed and new ones can be added. Website is responsive.
